# DeepIRS
A repository for the DeepIRS project codes

deepmu.m is the main file (standing for deep multi-user)

You can run it in MATLAB in a cell-by-cell fashion.

It calls several other functions/scripts, some of them are developed by me, and others are borrowed from the code by Al-Khateeb et. al. when generating channels from his DeepMIMO dataset.

Channels are currently generated simply as circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian to have the direct link as well. Still awaiting the updated dataset from Al-Khateeb to use his ray-traced data.
